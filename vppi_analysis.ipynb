    "## **Step 1: Valorant Player Performance Index (VPPI) â€” Theoretical Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring a player's true skill level is crucial in competitive Valorant, not just for teams but also for supporters and analysts. In the team-based shooter Valorant, winning depends on having fast reflexes and accurate aim. A fair and equal method of comparing players is required for competitions such as the VCT (Valorous Champions Tour). For this reason, I developed the Valorant Player Performance Index (VPPI), a score that illustrates an individual's total performance by combining several statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VCT Challengers league provided us with real player data, which contains a wealth of helpful statistics from real games. Among these statistics are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average combat score (ACS)**\n",
    "- **Kill/death ratio (K/D)**\n",
    "- **Headshot percentage**\n",
    "- **Clutch success rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "We separate performance into three main categories based on these statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggression**: The frequency of the player's first kill, their ACS, and their headshot shooting accuracy.\n",
    "- **Survivability**: The frequency with which they do not die first and the quality of their K/D ratio.\n",
    "- **Impact**: How frequently they assist teammates, win clutches, and participate in trades (KAST).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final VPPI is calculated by adding the scores from each of these categories. Compared to using K/D alone, this provides us with a far more complete picture of a player's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "VPPI works across many playstyles since our dataset includes a large number of players, teams, and agency roles. It is a useful tool for identifying up-and-coming talent, assembling competitive teams, and fairly comparing players. It can help analysts and coaches better recognise who is actually doing well.\n"

    "## **Step 2: Data Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The full stat profiles of more than 60 Valorant players participating in the VCT Challengers league are included in the vct-challengers.json dataset, which was used for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many in-game performance metrics available in this dataset, we only chose a subset of variables that are directly relevant to the Valorant Player Performance Index (VPPI) calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Selected Variables and Their Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rating**: A multi-statistic overall performance indicator that is helpful for comparing results to a baseline.\n",
    "- **kills_per_round**: This metric, which is essential for evaluating aggression, gauges a player's steady kill production per round.\n",
    "- **first_kills_per_round**: This indicator, which is crucial for the Aggression Index, shows how frequently a player starts battles.\n",
    "- **clutch_success_percentage**: Crucial for Impact, indicates how frequently a player wins rounds in 1vX scenarios.\n",
    "- **kill_deaths**: The ratio of kills to deaths is frequently used to demonstrate overall efficacy in gunfights.\n",
    "- **headshot_percentage**: Indicates the accuracy of aiming; this is particularly important for players with strong mechanical skills.\n",
    "- **average_combat_score (ACS)**: Riot's weighted metric that takes into consideration damage, kills, and impacts per round.\n",
    "- **assists_per_round**: This statistic, which is helpful for assessing support roles, highlights a player's contribution to team play.\n",
    "- **first_deaths_per_round**: This inverse measure of survival has a negative effect on rounds if someone dies first.\n",
    "- **average_damage_per_round (ADR)**: Indicates how much consistent damage a player contributes per round.\n",
    "- **kill_assists_survived_traded (KAST)**: Indicates if a player often engages in useful activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fields Discarded**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **agent**: Discontinued until performance by agent type is examined.\n",
    "- **team, region, playerName**: Only kept for context and filtering; not utilised in index calculation.\n",
